# SDM-Resources

This is my attempt at compiling a bunch of resources that helped me prepare for an SDM role. 

## SDM Role expectation

SDM is a person who is expected to make decisions to ensure success to project and the team. He is a leader who works for his team and not viceversa. Some of the key expectations would be

* Good grasp of technical landscape and ability to suggest improvements, identify issues and provide guidance. This is not the main job and we'll have SDEs taking care, but as a leader it'll be expected to have a good understanding to help team make progress and prioratise effectively and communicate well to the leadership

* Data driven decision making. Identify data points, measurement of successes and decisions based on data

* Good and people management, which includes identifying their potential, assessing their current contributions, chalk out a career path and set appropriate goals for them to help grow in their career. 

* Good at project management, this includes status reporting, prioratizations, stake holder management, escalation etc. and how you have demonstrated the appropriate skills during appropriate situations effectively. 

Amazon makes all its decisions based on it's (Leadership principles)[https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles]. Keeping them in mind and answers exhibiting a variety of these across different scenarios would help. 


## Interview Rounds and Expectations

Most candidates will have a screening round with their Hiring Manager to check their role fitment, following which the recruiter will schedule the next set of intervews. 

I had to complete a writing assessment before the day my first round of interview.

### Writing Exercise
Amazon has a cluture of writing. Every meeting will mostly involve reading through a material in silence before jumping into a discussion. This makes it an indespensible skill to have. The factors apart from technical/ functional understanding that would be checked are

- Clarity of thought and expression (i.e. did you explain your point well?)
- Organization and structure (i.e. does it flow? does it make sense?)
  
It would typically be a 1500 word long document, on a topic of choice ( you'll be given 2 choices ). I only remember one of the 2 scenarios given to me and that one was 

> Write about a difficult situation that you overcame using an innovative solution


### 5 Rounds Of Interview

These interviews cover a varied spread of sbjects, but mostly will be checking the individuals ability to exhibit leadership principles. Refer the useful links for leadership principles. 

One of the KEY things is to exhibit various leadership principles across different questions that are answered. Each round checks for 2-3 leadership principles each. For an SDM L5/ L6  excepting for **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility** and **Strive to be Earthâ€™s Best Employer**, everything is important and should be exhibited at different levels.

Answering the questions should always follow the STAR format
  - Situation : Explain the context of the problem domain
  - Task: Talk about the exact issue / task that you were expected to solve
  - Action: Mention about the action
  - Result: Explain the outcome of your actions. Data as much as possible

Some of the questions that I was asked are

* Talk about a time when you had to work on a performance issue of an employee. What did you do and how did it turn out?
    - If you narrate a positive situation, where the employee was able to successfully come back and become a super star, a followup on other end of the spectrum could also be asked. 
    - Preferably start with a positive outcome and follow it up with the other scenario when asked for ( unless the question explicitly asks otherwise )
* Explain a situation where you had to disagree with your manager/ leadership
* Tell me a time when you had to take a decision with very little data points
* Explain about a complex project that you have worked with ( and followup tech questions from the same )
* Few basic algo questions such as "deduplicating a sorted array, with low space and time complexity" and finding the "max sum path in a graph of data"
    - For these questions, you'll be asked to explain your answer. You can take the aid of a screen sharing as well in case you want to explain with notepad. But talking through the solution would suffice. 
* How do you keep your leadership updated with project status
* Tell me a time where you were able to come up with a non-obvious/innovative solution
* Talk about a time when you had to agree with others, though you knew its not the ideal / right way to solve a problem
* Talk about a time when you were able work with multiple teams/stake holders and get them to a common agreement


PLEASE NOTE: The first question is a gateway. Followup questions are the real ones which will help interviewer understand if you really have the experience or if you are bluffing. Bring truthful as much as possible helps. 


#### One Technical round
   
There will be a full technical round. This is for system design and I got a question to design a system to help with "Type ahead/suto suggest system for  Book search". Their expectation would be to find out the datastructure that would be apt for the solution, not really on whether u know different AWS components. 

I started off with Elastic search, REDIS, CDN  based solution. But finally figured it required implementation of TRIE data structure.

Looking at such standard system design problems will be a good idea. 


## Prep Strategy That Helped Me

Each interview gives you the opportunity to talk a lot about yourself in the period of about 40 - 50 min.  So being well prepared and giving as precise an answer as possible helps show case as much information as possible, to click to your advantage. 

Challenge is that during the interview, it becomes difficult to identify a scenario and explain it. Also choosing the right scenario for the right questions becomes critical to be able to showcase the leadership qualities effectively. 

For this I 

* Stuck all the 12 leadership principles on the wall horizontaly
* Work on documenting as much as possible from your career, various experiences. More the experiences better. 
* Now under each of these 12 leadership principles, identify 1 or more experiences that maps under each of these experiences and make a note
* Some of these incidents may apply for more than 1, that is ok. But try to have multiple options per leadership principle
* You'll have a matrix of sorts. Keep revising this list again and again for easy retrieval. 

Generally during interview

* Avoid giving the same scenarios ( across interviewers as well ) for different situations. This will help show that your experiences are diverse and multi-dimensional
* If there comes a situation, where you feel that a scenario that you had explained earlier in another interview would make more sense here, you can call out that you gave the example as part of another interview as well, but here it seems more apt. If time permits, you may follow it up with another close example if available. 
* Try to take less than 5 min for Situation and Task explanation. Spend more time on action and results part. But you may use your judgement wisely if you feel that the situation requires more time to explain. 
* In course of an interview, maximum of 3 questions may be asked, and based on the answers, there may be branching out and followup questions. You can lead the interviewer to where you want based on your answers. 



## Few Tips About Amazon

* People are data driven. If you can exhibit that, then nothing like that
* Leadership is a servent leader model - you do not delegate, but you are helping people who have high ownership levels. 
* People growth is a very high priority and taken seriously
* Process is extremely important. Cutting lines and shortcuts do not work here
* They have a writing culture and will expect people with good writing skills
* Trying to be as direct as possible helps to make effective decisions

These are some of the abilities that would be expected to be exhibited by the prospective SDMs.
