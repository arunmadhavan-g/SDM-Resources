# SDM-Resources

This is my attempt at compiling a bunch of resources that helped me prepare for an SDM role. 

## SDM Role expectation

SDM is a person who is expected to make decisions to ensure success to project and the team. He is a leader who works for his team and not viceversa. Some of the key expectations would be

* Good grasp of technical landscape and ability to suggest improvements, identify issues and provide guidance. This is not the main job and we'll have SDEs taking care, but as a leader it'll be expected to have a good understanding to help team make progress and prioratise effectively and communicate well to the leadership

* Data driven decision making. Identify data points, measurement of successes and decisions based on data

* Good and people management, which includes identifying their potential, assessing their current contributions, chalk out a career path and set appropriate goals for them to help grow in their career. 

* Good at project management, this includes status reporting, prioratizations, stake holder management, escalation etc. and how you have demonstrated the appropriate skills during appropriate situations effectively. 

Amazon makes all its decisions based on it's (Leadership principles)[https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles]. Keeping them in mind and answers exhibiting a variety of these across different scenarios would help. 


## Interview Rounds and Expectations

Most candidates will have a screening round with their Hiring Manager to check their role fitment, following which the recruiter will schedule the next set of intervews. 

I had to complete a writing assessment before the day my first round of interview.

### Writing Exercise
Amazon has a cluture of writing. Every meeting will mostly involve reading through a material in silence before jumping into a discussion. This makes it an indespensible skill to have. The factors apart from technical/ functional understanding that would be checked are

- Clarity of thought and expression (i.e. did you explain your point well?)
- Organization and structure (i.e. does it flow? does it make sense?)
  
It would typically be a 1500 word long document, on a topic of choice ( you'll be given 2 choices ). I only remember one of the 2 scenarios given to me and that one was 

> Write about a difficult situation that you overcame using an innovative solution


### 5 Rounds Of Interview

These interviews cover a varied spread of sbjects, but mostly will be checking the individuals ability to exhibit leadership principles. Refer the useful links for leadership principles. 

One of the KEY things is to exhibit various leadership principles across different questions that are answered. Each round checks for 2-3 leadership principles each. For an SDM L5/ L6  excepting for **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility** and **Strive to be Earthâ€™s Best Employer**, everything is important and should be exhibited at different levels.
